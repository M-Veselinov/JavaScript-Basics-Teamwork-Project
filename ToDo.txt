ball class and object -> render + movement

ball collision detection -> walls (bounce OR die), platforms (bounce), obstacles (bounce and kill)

we need images for the obstacle -> cut in equal! squares
450 x 300 image size / 30 x 30 squares

obstacle class and objectS -> render + disappear on collision

lives counter and visualisation

game over + restart game when lives == 0

think of a smart game name

style the html page + the canvas (cool colors, team name)

create presentation (2-3 slides + team members' names)

if there's time left -> add some tweaks
